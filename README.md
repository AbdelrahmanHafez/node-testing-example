# node-testing-example

This is an example project for a [discussion](https://github.com/i0natan/nodebestpractices/issues/271) on [Node Best Practices](https://github.com/i0natan/nodebestpractices).

Note that this example is only for demonstration purposes for the scope of the discussion above.
It does *NOT* follow the best practices, uses IO processes in its tests, and the tests do not pass.
